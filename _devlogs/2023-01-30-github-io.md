Documentation of how this website was made and its growth. :)

## 1. Copy Website Template and Host on GitHub

For every personal github account, you can host a website for free at `https://[your GitHub username].github.io`.
For my website (the one you're looking at) it's `https://gr-grey.github.io`.

* Fork Academicpages GitHub Pages Template
    * The template comes from [https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). 
    * Fork to get my own copy to have fun with.
* Host on GitHub
    * Go to my github page, rename the repo from "academicpages.github.io" to "gr-grey.github.io"
    * The website should be live at "https://gr-grey.github.io" (might take a minute for github to compile things).
    * At first, it should look exactly like [https://academicpages.github.io/](https://academicpages.github.io/) (since it's a copy).
    * It comes with many useful guidance of website formats and markdowns in general. Look around and explore!

## 2. Host Locally for Better Development Experience.

To avoid waiting for ages to see the changes after pushing to GitHub.
It's a good idea to serve the website locally.
So I can mess around and immediately know what I broke.

* Instructions can be found in the [README](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io#readme) pages of the template.
* The website is served in WSL2 enviorment with these commands

```bash
sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
bundle clean
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

* The site can be accessed at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), or [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).

* Notes
    * the `bundle clean` command had error, but didn't seem to be a real problem
    * `bundle exec jekyll serve` is needed for first time serving. Afterwards run `jekyll serve` to serve the website locally.

* Extra Notes (for me)
    * Added `alias jgrep="grep --exclude-dir=_site -r"` to my zshrc, as I found myself grep excluding the `_site` folder too many times.
    * Added `.jekyll-metadata` to .gitignore as local server created that.

## 3. Fill in Infos

* The ["\_config.yml"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) field contains basic info such as site name, your name, url, email, twitter, linkedin and so on
* Modified ["\_includes/author-profile.html"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_includes/author-profile.html): changed `site.data.ui-text[site.locale].email_label` to `author.email`; as I found explicitly displaying the email address on the left side bar is more useful than saying "Email".

## 4. Navigation Bar & Structual Changes

* Navigation buttons are set in the ["\_data/navigation.yml"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml)  file
* Restructure my naviation bars to CV > Publication > NGS > Blogs > Dev-log
* Comment out ones I don't need
* NGS column
    * Add NGS title and /ngs/ url in navigation.yml file
    * Create ["\_pages/ngs.md"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_pages/ngs.md) Note that permalink needs to match with the \ngs\ url.
* Dev Logs column
    * Add Dev Log title and /dev-logs/ url in navigation.yml file
    * Create ["\_devlogs"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/tree/master/_devlogs) folder to store articles in this catogory
    * In the ["\_config.yml"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) file, add "devlogs" entry to both "collections:" and "defaults:" fields (or else site.devlogs can't fine the files in \_devlogs folder);  
    * Create ["\_pages/dev-log.html"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_pages/dev-logs.html) . The file is based on Blogs page - ["\_pages/year-archive.html"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_pages/year-archive.html), as it'll display blogs of programming and development records.
        * Changed `for post in site.posts` to `for post in site.devlogs reversed` to load files in the \_devlogs folder, and for newer dates to show up first.
    * Write up this post ["\_devlogs/2023-01-30-github-io.md"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_devlogs/2023-01-30-github-io.md), with `collection: devlogs` in the front matter.
* Courses column - parallel operations to Dev Logs
    * Add Courses title and /courses/ url in navigation.yml file
    * Create ["\_courses"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/tree/master/_courses) folder to store articles in this catogory
    * In the ["\_config.yml"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) file, add "courses" entry to both "collections:" and "defaults:" fields (or else site.courses can't fine the files in \_courses folder);  
    * Create ["\_pages/courses.html"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_pages/courses.html) . The file is based on Blogs page - ["\_pages/year-archive.html"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_pages/year-archive.html), as it'll display blogs of programming and development records.
        * Changed `for post in site.posts` to `for post in site.courses reversed` to load files in the \_courses folder, and for newer dates to show up first.
    * Creat ["\_courses/2023-01-31-introduction-to-genomics.md"](https://github.com/gr-grey/gr-grey.github.io/blob/master/_courses/2023-01-31-introduction-to-genomics.md) file, with `collection: courses` in the front matter.
