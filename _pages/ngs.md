As I want to shift my focus towards genomic and bioinformatics related research.
I took [Genomic Data Science Sepcialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) courses offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

Courses include **Introduction to Genomics Technologies**, **Command Line Tools for Genomics**, **Python for Genomics** and **Algorithms for DNA Sequencing**.
Certificates are listed at the [end of the page](#certificates).

# Course Notes

## [Introduction to Genomics](/courses/2023/03/introduction-to-genomics/)

* A summary of genomic-related topics, containing notes  I took from the [Introduction to Genomics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-genomics) course from JHU, and [Applied Computational Genomics](https://github.com/quinlan-lab/applied-computational-genomics) course from Dr. Aaron Quinlan at U of Utah, with a splash of my understandings on these topics.

## [Common File Formats and Software in Genomics](/courses/2023/03/common-file-formats-and-software-in-genomics/)

* A review of common formats in genomics: SAM/BAM, BED, GFF3/GFF/GTF, VCF/BCF, FastA/Q, as well as 3 course projects (adapted for better clarity).

    - [Project 1](/courses/2023/03/common-file-formats-and-software-in-genomics/#seg9): Unix basic (grep, cut, awk, comm, sort, uniq)
    - [Project 2](/courses/2023/03/common-file-formats-and-software-in-genomics/#seg10): Process SAM/BAM/BED/GTF files
    - [Project 3](/courses/2023/03/common-file-formats-and-software-in-genomics/#seg11): Align FastQ reads with bowtie2 and variant calling with bfctools

The course material came out in 2014 and some of the software it uses are obselete now - it made me realize how fast things are moving in computational genomics, where the ability to learn and keep up with new algorithms and tools are crucial.

## Python for Genomics Data Science

* The course gives a brief introduction to python, and some broad advice of coding styles.
* I keep a [python note](/dev-logs/2023/04/python-notes/) for quick look ups.

## Algorithms for DNA Sequencing

* The course covers the math and practical implementation of algorithms for DNA sequence alignment and assembly.
- It was hands down the most fun I've had in the course series, algorithms from **naive exact matching** to **Boyer Moore** to **Smith-Waterman dynamic programming** are a lot fun to learn and play with. Notes of the course and projects are to come in the future.
