Research Experience
======

### **2017 - 2023: Graduate Research Associate**, University of Pennsylvania
Applying a statistical model to solve the protein design problem, i.e., calculating amino acid sequences that when synthesized, fold into target 3D protein structures, to create proteins that possess desired functionalities, such as high thermal stability, enzyme activity or host-guest assemblies
- **Computational Protein Design**: 2 projects • 18 designed proteins • 16 confirmed to fold correctly
- **Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations**: Uncovering unstable interactions in problematic sequences

For details of grad research, please refer to [Research](/research/) page.
 
### **2014 - 2016: Undergraduate Researcher**, University of Science and Technology of China
- Synthesized 3 microporous anion exchange membranes (crucial component of fuel cells) with exceptional high hydroxide conductivity and chemical stability. At the time of publication, one of the membranes demonstrated the highest conductivity at 80 °C reported in the field.
