That's enough about me.
Now here's a peice of great advice from the Sunscreen Song:

"Enjoy your body. It's the greatest instrument you'll even own." <br>

And here are some topics I take great interests in.

Harness Computing Power to Help Understand Biology
======
The human body is an intricate machine, 
and documenting the *Human User Manual* is a hard and intriguing problem.

We have yet to fully understand the function of sleep, the cause of aging and various diseases, how the cocktail of neurochemical molecules shape our mental and physical states, and leads to fascinating (and sometimes bizarre) human behaviors. 

The rapid increase of the computing power allows us to process huge amount data and perform massive searches, and to implement more intelligent models (like AlphaFold2 with its 21 million parameters network). 

Computation offers us greater tools than ever to understand biology, and I wish to make a small contribution to that.

Computational Protein Design, Genomics and Programing
------

- **Computational Protein Design/Engineering** 
    - My graduate research focuses on solving the protein design problem - the reverse problem of the protein folding problem (the one Google's AlphaFold2 AI solves).
    - Very briefly, the design problem is given the protein's 3D backbone structure, can we find the amino acid sequence(s) that fold into the predeterimined structure?
    - It allows us to create brand new proteins outside of evolution, and modify exisiting proteins with desired functionalities without disturbing the folded structure.
    - For more details of my projects, see [Research](/research/) page.

- **Genomics and Next Generation Sequencing**
    - The DNA - our source code, contains fascinating information about our biology. For example, a single mutation will decide whether your face flushes after consuming alcohol (guess which genotype I am). There are genes associated with depression, aggression, pro-/anti-social behaviors and cognitions.
    - The human body is the most intricate machine we will ever own, yet we still haven't figured out the user manual on how to operate it porperly.
    - I believe the exponentially growth of sequening rate (and decreasing of cost) has made genomics research one of the most powerful tools to study biology, and I hope to explore the landscape of bioinformatics and genomics as I carry on the journey of computational biology. 

- **Programming**
    - Coding is an activity I enjoy, both the puzzle solving (math) aspect and the joy of building something. Besides, who doesn't love to argue over which language/IDE/framework is the best, and face the challenge of some obsure and poorly documented tools/software that require act of gods to compile? :)


Example of An Intriging Biology Question 
------
I'd like to leave you with a fasciating piece of unsolved biology, brought up by the famous behavior biologist Dr. Rob Sapolsky in his lecture:

> You will have done more good for the health of humanity, than anyone since Jonas Salk inventing the polio vaccine, if you can answer this question: <br>
> **Why is it that when we feel like nobody loves us, we eat Oreo cookies?** <br>
> Answer this question, and you have just solved half the cases of diabetes in this country.
