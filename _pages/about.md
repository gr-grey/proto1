That's enough about me.
Now here's some great advice from the Sunscreen Song:

"Enjoy your body. It's the greatest instrument you'll even own." <br>

Harness Computing Power to Help Understand Biology
======
The human body is an intricate and wonderful machine, with a poorly documented user manual.

We have yet to fully understand the function of sleep, the cause of aging and various diseases, how the cocktail of neurochemical molecules shape our mental and physical states, that eventually lead to some bizarre human behaviors. 

<!---
The famous behavior biologist Dr. Rob Sapolsky once said: 

You will have done more good for the health of humanity, than anyone since Jonas Salk inventing the polio vaccine, if you can answer this question:

**why is it that when we feel like nobody loves us, we eat Oreo cookies?** 

Answer this question, and you have just solved half the cases of diabetes in this country.
-->

Decoding and documenting the *Human User Manual* is a hard and intriguing question.
The rapid increase of the computing power allows us to process massive data and perform massive searches, and to implement more intelligent and complicated models (alphafold2's network has 21 million parameters). 

The advance in computational biology offers us better chance than ever to tackle the challenging problems in biology, and I wish to make a small contribution to that.

Computational Protein Design & Engineering
------
Is my research topic in graduate school.

Genomics and Next Generation Sequencing
------
Is what I hope to do next

Coding
------
Is a very cool thing that I enjoy.
